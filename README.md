We demonstrate how to simulate the navigation algorithms for an Autonomous Surface Vessel(ASV) with complete system models and diverse scenarios. The task of the ASV is to navigate through a busy canal where other moving ships are present.

## Setup 
To Run:
1. download the whole zip
2. unzip it
3. open "StartASVDemo.mlx"
4. Follow the script to run the code step by step
